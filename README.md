# Predicting Employee Attrition using Logistic Regression

🎓 This is my first regression analysis using Python!  
I trained a logistic regression model to predict whether employees are likely to leave a company using features like job satisfaction, overtime status, department, age, and more.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn)
- Google Colab
- GitHub

## 🔢 Key Steps
- Cleaned and prepped the dataset
- Created dummy variables for categorical data
- Split the data into training and test sets
- Trained a logistic regression model
- Measured accuracy, F1 score, and confusion matrix
- Interpreted feature importance with coefficients

## 📊 Results
- Overtime, working in Sales, and low years at the company were strong predictors of attrition
- Employees in HR and older workers were less likely to leave
- Model achieved 100% accuracy on a small test sample (due to small dataset)
